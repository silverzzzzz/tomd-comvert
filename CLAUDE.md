## Project Overview

This appears to be a minimal repository with only a README file present. The repository is named "tomd-comvert" and is currently in a very early stage with minimal structure.

## Current State

- The repository contains only a single `Readme.md` file
- No package configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) are present
- No source code files have been created yet
- No build tools, test frameworks, or development dependencies are configured

## Development Commands

Currently, no specific build, test, or development commands are available as the project structure has not been established.

## Next Steps for Development

When developing in this repository, you'll likely need to:
1. Determine the intended programming language and framework
2. Set up the appropriate project structure and configuration files
3. Establish build and development workflows
4. Create the core application files

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.
